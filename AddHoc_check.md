*  check 4.3_615 whether has to use Queue max size X
    * Rewrote
*  Why python Queue is so fucking wired? when call .get() it hangs X
    * becuase it's not supposed to be used as a single thread DS
*  Running Time for BFS Problems
*  Dijkstra algorithm.  what, why it works, complexity
*  check answer for 4.5
    * time limit exceed for BFS
    * have to use Dijkstra algorithm for Python implementation
*  What is Deque
    * DS for to act as queue or stack, implemented as doubly linkedlist
*  Seqeuence COnstruction
*  check 2.10 use nums[mid] < nums[end] judge
