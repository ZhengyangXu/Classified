Description
______________
Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher
write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia:
"A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each
and the other N âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each."
For example, given citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5], which means the researcher
has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at
least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, his h-index is 3.

Approach
________________
Smart-ass Bucket Sort
++++++++++++++++++++++
1. establish n buckets
   - bucket i represents i references, value represents the count
   - value in bucket n represnets the count of references >= n
2. Walk backwards for the buckets and maintain a count += value
   - when count is larger or equal to i
     we return i
