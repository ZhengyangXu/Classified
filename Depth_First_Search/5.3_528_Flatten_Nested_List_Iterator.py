"""
Given a nested list of integers, implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
Example
Given the list [[1,1],2,[1,1]], By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,1,2,1,1].

Given the list [1,[4,[6]]], By calling next repeatedly until hasNext returns false, the order of elements returned by next should be: [1,4,6].
